# JIRA Integration Testing - Durable Memory

## Date: 2026-02-16
## Project: Atlassian JIRA Integration Testing
## Status: ✅ READ-ONLY TEST COMPLETED

## Executive Summary
Successfully tested read-only integration with user's JIRA instance. Authentication works, but instance appears to be new/empty with no projects or issues yet.

## Integration Details

### JIRA Instance Information
- **URL**: `https://wimalasuriyaib.atlassian.net/`
- **Authentication**: API token provided by user
- **Email**: `indika@byc.lk`
- **Token**: `ATATT3xFfGF0...` (truncated for security)
- **Version**: Jira Cloud (1001.0.0-SNAPSHOT)
- **Deployment Type**: Cloud
- **Server Time Zone**: UTC
- **Build Date**: 2026-02-15T15:48:48.000+0530

### Test Results
1. **✅ Authentication Test**: PASSED
   - `serverInfo` endpoint returns 200 OK
   - Basic auth with email:token works correctly
   - API version compatible with OpenClaw

2. **✅ Read Access Test**: PASSED
   - Can query project list (returns empty array)
   - Can search for issues (returns empty array)
   - No permission errors encountered

3. **✅ Scope Compliance**: PASSED
   - Only read operations performed
   - No writes or deletes attempted
   - User approval obtained before testing

### Current State Analysis
- **Projects**: 0 (empty array from `/rest/api/3/project/search`)
- **Issues**: 0 (empty array from `/rest/api/3/search/jql`)
- **Conclusion**: JIRA instance is **new/empty**, ready for initial setup

## Technical Implementation Notes

### API Endpoints Tested
1. `GET /rest/api/3/serverInfo` - ✅ Success (200)
2. `GET /rest/api/3/project/search` - ✅ Success (empty)
3. `GET /rest/api/3/search/jql` - ✅ Success (empty)

### Authentication Method
```bash
# Base64 encoded email:token
Authorization: Basic $(echo -n 'email:token' | base64 -w 0)
```

### API Compatibility
- Uses JIRA REST API v3
- Cloud deployment (different from server/DC)
- Modern endpoints (e.g., `/search/jql` instead of deprecated `/search`)

## User Preferences Applied
1. **Approval First**: Asked for and received explicit approval before testing
2. **Read-Only**: Only performed read operations as specified
3. **No Automation**: Didn't set up any automated systems
4. **Simple Approach**: Basic connectivity test without complexity

## Security Considerations
1. **Token Handling**: Used only for approved test, not stored permanently
2. **Scope Limitation**: Read-only operations only
3. **No Persistence**: Credentials not saved to files
4. **Transparent Reporting**: Full results shared with user

## Next Steps (When Approved)
1. **Project Setup**: Help create initial project(s) in JIRA
2. **Issue Creation**: Add sample tasks/bugs for testing
3. **Workflow Design**: Set up columns, statuses, transitions
4. **Integration Planning**: Connect JIRA with other tools/systems

## Lessons Learned
1. **JIRA Cloud API**: Different from server/DC, uses modern endpoints
2. **Authentication**: Email + API token works with base64 encoding
3. **Empty Instances**: Need to handle gracefully (no projects/issues)
4. **User Approval**: Critical for any integration work

- **API Docs**: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/intro/

## Conclusion
JIRA integration capability confirmed. The instance is ready for project setup and issue creation. Future work can proceed with user approval for write operations and workflow design.

**Next Session Context:** JIRA connectivity established, instance empty, ready for setup when user approves.
